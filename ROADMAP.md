* **October 2025** – **Partners:** Release **Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Manuals** (with accompanying videos/tutorials) to help CSPs integrate with Ratio1.

* **October 2025** – **Core Tech:** Add **ARM64 support for Tegra devices** (NVIDIA Jetson family).  This brings full Ratio1 runtime to AI-capable edge GPUs, in line with the plan to "port the runtime to non-x86 platforms".

* **November 2025** – **Core Tech:** Extend **ARM64 support to other platforms** (e.g. Raspberry Pi and RISC-V devices) and add **native MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) support** for Apple GPUs.  This furthers Ratio1’s goal of broad heterogeneous-device compatibility.

* **November 2025** – **Partners:** Publish third tutorial series (AI/ML Templates #3) offering pre-built application templates for common workflows.

* **December 2025** – **Core Tech:** Release **SDK v4** and **ED v3** (enhanced encrypted learning).  This upgrade includes improvements to the EDIL (Encrypted Decentralized Inference and Learning) framework, enabling more efficient homomorphic encrypted training and inference.  Also launch a devnet/testnet for **automated agent-driven Edge Nodes** (fully autonomous edge node software).

* **December 2025** – **Partners:** Official v1 release of the **Creation Toolkit** and **LabelCraft** (stable 1.0 versions), completing the AI-for-Everyone suite.

## 2026 Key Milestones
