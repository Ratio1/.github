## üöÄ Welcome to Ratio1

Ratio1 is revolutionizing AI accessibility through our groundbreaking **Decentralized Neuro-symbolic Autonomous processing framework (Ratio1 DNA)**. We're building the ultimate AI Meta Operating System that transforms everyday devices into powerful AI processing nodes, creating a trustless, privacy-preserving, and economically sustainable ecosystem.

### üéØ Our Mission

To democratize AI by eliminating traditional barriers through blockchain-powered infrastructure that enables instant AI deployment, reduces costs, and rewards community participation.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

### Ratio1 DNA Framework

Our proprietary **Ratio1 DNA** (Decentralized Neuro-symbolic Autonomous processing) framework represents a paradigm shift in AI democratization. This revolutionary architecture enables:

- **Trustless Micro-transactions**: Blockchain-validated processing reduces entry barriers
- **Edge Computing Network**: Transform consumer devices into AI supercomputers
- **Low-Code Development**: Deploy AI applications without DevOps teams

### Three-Tier Node Ecosystem

**Genesis Node Deed (GND)**: The foundational node exclusively held by the Ratio1 Foundation, activating the entire ecosystem.

**Master Node Deeds (MND)**: Specialized licenses for development teams and initial investors, supporting core ecosystem functions over 30+ months.

**Node Deeds (ND)**: Public licenses enabling individual edge node operation within the decentralized infrastructure.
